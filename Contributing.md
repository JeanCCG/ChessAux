## Interface Flow of the App
![flow_of_interfaces_in_the_app](interface_flow.drawio.svg)
human vs computer and human vs human interfaces generate a game_setting object that will be used to configure the game.

## TODO's

install the todo app in vscode.

## Other

This is the command I use to build the release build type.
```bash
cmake -S . -B ./build && cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ./build && cd ./build && make -j $(nproc) && ./UCSP_Chess
## OR, build like any other project, it builds in Debug by default
cmake -S . -B ./build && cmake --build ./build && cd ./build && make -j $(nproc) && ./UCSP_Chess
```

some aliases that might improve your life quality. Add these in your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`
```bash
alias gbuild='cd ./build || cd ../build || cd ../../build'
alias cmors='rm -rf build && cmake -S . -B ./build && cmake --build ./build && gbuild && make -j $(nproc)'
alias cmors_debug='rm -rf build && cmake -S . -B ./build && cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ./build && gbuild && make -j $(nproc)'
alias cmors_release='rm -rf build && cmake -S . -B ./build && cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ./build && gbuild all && make -j $(nproc)'
```

if you added the aliases to your profile you can build the project as follows:
```bash
cmors && ./UCSP_Chess # to default debug built type
cmors_debug && ./UCSP_Chess # to build the debug built type
cmors_release && ./UCSP_Chess # to build the release built type
```
